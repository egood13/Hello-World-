# Hello-World-
github tutorial

Hello,

My name is Elliott Good and I am a financial analyst with a background in Physics (B.S.). When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games, hiking (when I can find time) and pursuing a master's degree in Operations Research. I use SQL and VBA (and very rarely, Python) in my day-to-day as a financial analyst in which I primarily work with the data going through the department. I also use Java, Python, and excel for my coursework in Operations Research.

I hope to use my educational foundation in Mathematics in conjunction with programming to extract knowledge from data and drive smart business decisions. If you have any questions or can offer any pieces of advice regarding my programs please feel free to email me at elliott.good13@gmail.com

Thanks,

Elliott Good
